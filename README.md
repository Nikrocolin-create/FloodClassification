This is a code for thesis for a track: Computer Science and Engineering(Politecnico di Milano).
In the file VGG_Flood_Classification used the pretrained model from the article: "Filtering Relevant Flood Images on Twitter using Content-based Filters"
In the file refactored_thesis used other pretrained model from the article: Evaluating the impact of floods on gender equality from social media evidence.

The goal of this work was to evaluate different flood classification models, compare them and train a new model, based on Xception Architecture.
